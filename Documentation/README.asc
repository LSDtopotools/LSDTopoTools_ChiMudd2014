= Chi analysis documentation

This documentation is written with http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]. 

You have a few options for looking at the documentation:

. Just grab the pdf.
. Click on `chi_analysis.asc`. This is probably the easiest option.
. Clone these files and build the website using asciidoctor. This last option is only if you are a crazy hacker. Really, just use the first two options. 

== If you really want to build the html files yourself. 

.Why not just 
**************************
Look, it is a lot easier just to grab the pdf. Why don't you do that?
**************************

Okay, if you really want to built the html files do this:
 
You will need to install https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[ruby], https://rubygems.org/[rubygems] and http://bundler.io/[bundler] to get it working. You probably will also need to install the Ruby development kit (see the Ruby website for that).

Install the ruby package `bundler` using

[source,console]
----
$ gem install bundler
----

== Turning these files into pdf or html

We will use http://bundler.io/[bundler], which manages http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] and a a bunch of other stuff, to turn these files into pdf and html. The template files do this work for you so all you need to do to egt started is install https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[ruby], https://rubygems.org/[rubygems] and http://bundler.io/[bundler] and then clone this repository into the directory of your choice from Github.

Once you have bundler installed, you can build the book with:

[source,console]
----
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
----

This will build *html* and *pdf* versions of the book.

You can also build an html only version:

[source,console]
----
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----

WARNING: The build process will make a folder called `images` in the root directory,
which on some systems must be deleted before new builds. This is a particular problem on Windows systems, where sometimes windows will stupidly not let you delete the `thumbs.db` file it automatically generates. To get around this, right click on the images directory and unselect `read only`, then you should be able to delete the folder. In general, however, as long as you do not look in the images directory you will not have this problem.
