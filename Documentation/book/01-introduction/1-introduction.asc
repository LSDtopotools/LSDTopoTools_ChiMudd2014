== Introduction

This section explains the theory behind analysis of channels using both slope-area analysis and chi (the greek letter latexmath:[\chi], which I have been https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPEtRc05G7Q#t=1m46s[pronouncing incorrectly for some time]) analysis.

=== Background

In the late 1800s, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grove_Karl_Gilbert[G.K. Gilbert] proposed that bedrock channel incision should be proportional to topographic gradients and the amount of water flowing in a channel.

[quote, G.K. Gilbert,Geology of the Henry Mountains 1877]
We have already seen that erosion is favored by declivity. Where the declivity is great the agents of erosion are powerful; where it is small they are weak; where there is no declivity they are powerless. Moreover it has been shown that their power increases with the declivity in more than simple ratio.

Since then, many geomorpholgists have attempted to extract information about erosion rates from channel profiles.
Chi analysis is a method of extracting information from channel profiles that attempts to compare channels with different discharges first proposed by https://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/lhroyden[Leigh Royden] and colleagues at MIT.
https://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] has a number of tools for performing chi analysis.

This document gives instructions on how to use the segment fitting tool for channel profile analysis
developed by http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/smudd[Simon Mudd] and colleagues at the http://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences[University of Edinburgh].
The tool is used to examine the geometry of channels using the integral method of channel profile analysis.

=== Channel incision and geometry

Following observations made by early workers such as Gilbert, later workers proposed models to explain erosion rates in channels. Many of these models state that erosion rate is proportional to both topographic slope and to discharge. The relationship to discharge is related to a number of factors, including how likely the river is to pluck material from the bed, and how much sediment it can carry. Bedload can damage the bed and thus bedload particles can act as "tools" to erode the bed. A number of formulations to capture this behaviour have been proposed (e.g. http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/94/6/739[Howard and Kerby, 1983]; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/94WR00757/abstract[Howard, 1994]; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1999JB900120/abstract[Whipple and Tucker 1999]; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009JF001655/abstract[Gasparini and Brandon, 2011]) and these formulations can be generalised into the stream power incision model (SPIM):

[latexmath]
++++
E = K A^m S^n 
++++

where _E_ is the long-term fluvial incision rate, _A_ is the upstream drainage area, _S_ is the channel gradient, _K_ is an erodibility coefficient, which is a measure of the efficiency of the incision process, and _m_ and _n$_are constant exponents.  In order to model landscape evolution, the SPIM is often combined with detachment-limited mass balance, where:

[latexmath]
++++
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = U - E = U - K A^m \Big(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x_d}\Big)^n 
++++


where _z_ is the elevation of the channel bed, _t_ is time, _x~d~_ is the distance downstream, and _U_ is the rock uplift rate, equivalent to the rate of baselevel lowering if the baselevel elevation is fixed.

In order to examine fluvial response to climatic and tectonic forcing, this differential equation is often rearranged for channel slope, assuming uniform incision rate:

[latexmath]
++++
S = k_{sn} A^{-\theta} 
++++

where latexmath:[\theta] = _m/n_, and represents the concavity of the channel profile, and latexmath:[k_{sn} = (E/K)^{\frac{1}{n}}], and represents the steepness of the profile.  latexmath:[\theta] and _k~sn~_ are referred to as the concavity and steepness indices respectively. This relationship therefore predicts a power-law relationship between slope and drainage area, which is often represented on a logarithmic scale.  The concavity and steepness indices can be extracted from plots of slope against drainage area along a channel, where latexmath:[\theta] is the gradient of a best-fit line through the data, and _k~sn~_ is the y-intercept. These slope-area plots have been used by many studies to examine fluvial response to climate, lithology and tectonics (e.g., http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/WR010i005p00969/abstract[Flint, 1974]; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/WR025i009p02037/abstract[Tarbonton et al., 1989]; http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/29/5/415.short[Kirby and Whipple 2001]; http://specialpapers.gsapubs.org/content/398/55.full.pdf[Wobus et al., 2006]).

However, there are limitations with using these plots of slope against drainage area in order to analyse channel profiles.  Topographic data is inherently noisy, either as a result of fine-scale sediment transport processes, or from processing of the data in the creation of DEMs.  Furthermore, this noise is amplified by the derivation of the topographic surface in order to extract values for channel gradient (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.3302/abstract[Perron and Royden, 2013]).  This noise leads to significant scatter within the profile trends, potentially obscuring any deviations from the power law signal which may represent changes in process, lithology, climate or uplift.  In order to circumvent these problems, more recent studies have turned to the `integral method' of slope-area analysis, which normalises river profiles for their drainage area, allowing comparison of the steepness of channels across basins of different size. The integral method only requires the extraction of elevation and drainage area along the channel, and is therefore less subject to topographic noise than slope-area analysis.  The technique involves integrating equation the stream power equation along the channel, assuming spatially constant incision equal to uplift (steady-state) and erodibility:

[latexmath]
++++
z(x) = z(x_b) + \Bigg(\frac{E}{K}\Bigg)^{\frac{1}{n}} \int_{x_b}^{x} \frac{dx}{A(x)^{\frac{m}{n}}}
++++

where the integration is performed upstream from baselevel (_x~b~_) to a chosen point on the river channel, _x_.  The profile is then normalised to a reference drainage area (_A~0~_) to ensure the integrand is dimensionless:

[latexmath]
++++
z(x) = z(x_b) + \Bigg(\frac{U}{K{A_0}^m}\Bigg)^{\frac{1}{n}} \chi
++++

where the longitudinal coordinate latexmath:[\chi] is equal to:

[latexmath]
++++
\chi = \int_{x_b}^{x} \Bigg(\frac{A_0}{A(x)}\Bigg)^{m/n} dx
++++

The longitudinal coordinate latexmath:[\chi] has dimensions of length, and is linearly related to the elevation _z(x)_.  Therefore, if a channel incises based on the stream power incision model, then its profile should be linear on a plot of elevation against latexmath:[\chi]. As well as providing a method to test whether channel profiles obey common incision models, latexmath:[\chi]-plots also provide means of testing the appropriate latexmath:[\theta] for a channel (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.3302/abstract[Perron and Royden, 2013]; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/full[Mudd et al., 2014]).  If the integral analysis is performed for all channels within a basin, the correct value of latexmath:[\theta] can be determined by identifying at which value all of the channels are both linear in latexmath:[\chi]-elevation space, and collinear, where main channel and tributaries all collapse onto a single profile.
