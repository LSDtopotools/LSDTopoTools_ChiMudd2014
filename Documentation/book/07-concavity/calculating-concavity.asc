== Calculating concavity

In this section you will find instructions on using the *chi mapping tool* to calculate channel concavity. What is channel concavity? If you look at typical channels, you will find steep headwaters but as you move downstream the channels will become gentler. Authors in the middle of the twentieth century began to calculate channel slope as one moved downstream and found sysematic relasionships between drainage area, _A_ and channel slope, _S_, finding that the relasionship could be described with stem:[S = k_s A^{-\theta}]. This relasionship is often called Flint's law, after a 1975 paper. The exponent, stem:[\theta], is called the concavity because it describes how concave the channel is: if the channel profile has little variation in slope downstream the channel has a low concavity. 

A number of models have been proposed for channel incision into bedrock, and a number of these models describe erosion as some funciton of slope and drainage area, and in the simplist version of these family of models, called stream power models, the concavity is related to the slope and area exponents, where erosion rate is modelled as stem:[E = k A^m S^n] and if uplift is balanced by erosion the predicted topographic outcome is stem:[\theta = m/n]. There is much debate about the appropriateness of these simple models but it is probably not controversial to say that most geomorphologists believe the concavity refelcts the transport and erosion processes taking place within upland river. 

In addition, a number of authors have used channel steepness to infer either erosion and uplift rates across river networks, and these calculations often involve computing the channel concavity. This can be done in a number of ways. We at *LSDTopoTools* have included a number of methods, both traditional and newly developed, for the purpose of computing the channel concavity in river networks. In this section you will find instructions for using our tools.
