=== Visualising the results of our m/n analyses

IMPORTANT: You need to run the analysis before any of this will work!

We have built a single python script that does all the visualisation for you. It works with one call to the script: _*easy peasy!!*_

Unfortunately there are a few hiccups in getting the python installed, which we describe in the section <<Setting up Python>>.

This will be slightly different than instructions in that section, since the advice there is to run python scripts from *spyder*. In this instance, we will run from command line. 

==== Generating all the plots

. If you are in Windows, you need to take care of a little problem first: <<Fixing python gdal in windows>>

. Now open a command shell window (search your star menu for *cmd.exe*).

. If you have installed a conda environment for *LSDTopoTools* (see the section <<Setting up Python>> for details), activate it with:
+
[source,console]
----
> activate LSDTT
----
+
. Now, go to the place you cloned *LSDMappingTools*. For instructions on that look here: <<Getting our plotting tools>>. You will need to use the `cd` command to get there.  
+ 
. Once you are in the correct directory, you need to run the python script:
+
[source,console]
----
> python PlotMoverNAnalysis.py -dir C:\VagrantBoxes\LSDTopoTools\Topographic_projects\LSDTT_chi_examples\ -fname movern_Xian -ALL True
----
+
Note here that we have assumed you have put your files, on your host machine, in `C:\VagrantBoxes\`. If your files are somewhere else you need to change this. The `-dir` flag wants the directory of the data and the `-fname` flag wants the prefix of the data. The `-ALL` flag means you want to do all the plotting. 
+
. This can take a little while. Why don't you relax and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcLhUiYrZhA[watch a video] while you wait?

==== What sort of plots do I get?

In your data directory you will now find not one, but four new directories:

* `raster_plots`
* `SA_plots`
* `chi_plots`
* `summary_plots`

These contain a cornucopia of images for you to explore. 

===== Figures in the *Raster_plots* directory

The *raster_plots* directory contains images of the extracted basins:

.The extracted basins for the _m/n_ analysis
image::images/movern_Xian_basin_keys.png[Basins around Mount Hua for _m/n_ analysis]

It also contains images of the most likeley _m/n_ ratio following three methods: slope-area analysis, collinearity analysis of chi profiles using all channel points, and collinearity using chi points at random intervals iterated upon using a Monte-Carlo scheme. Our extensive testing against numerical models under ideal conditions suggest the least trustworthy of these extracted _m/n_ ratios is the slope-area data, whereas the most trustworthy are the data derived from the Monte Carlo chi approach. It is not possible to know which of these methods is "true" but if all methods agree you can have high confidence in the _m/n_ ratio and if they disagree our guidance is to use the Monte Carlo chi method.

===== Figures in the *SA_plots* directory

This folder contains two versions of slope-area plots. The first contains the slope area data of all the tributaries, for example:

.S-A data of all channels in the basin
image::images/movern_Xian_SA_plot_raw_and_binned_basin6.png[S-A data of all channels in the basin]

The second set of S-A data contains only the trunk channel and also has segments extracted from the http://www.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/abstract[Mudd et al. (2014)] segmentation algorithm. 

.S-A data of the trunk stream with statistically extracted segments.

===== Figures in the *chi_plots* directory

This directory has a large number of images: each chi-elevation plot for each basin for each _m/n_ tested. If you are seeing interesting patterns in the raster data you should absolutely explore these plots to see what the chi profiles are doing as you vary _m/n_.

===== Figures in the *summary_plots* directory

We also print summary plots that let you explore the variation of computed _m/n_ values across a landscape. There are three plots in this directory and two *.csv* files that contain the underlying data. The three plots are

. A plot showing the best fit _m/n_ as a function of basin key that inclde the various chi methods and the slope-area method using a regression through all the data. 
+
.Summary plot of most likely _m/n_ ratio for various methods

+
. A plot showing the best fit _m/n_ as a function of basin key that inclde the various chi methods and the slope-area method using a regression through all segments and tributaries. These S-A data tend to have very high varibility, as reflected in the uncertainty bands. 
+
. A plot showing the probability of different _m/n_ values of each of the different methods plotted as a http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/07/joyplots.html[joyplot].
