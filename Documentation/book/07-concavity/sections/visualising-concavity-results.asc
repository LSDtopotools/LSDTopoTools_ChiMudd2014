=== Visualising the results of our m/n analyses

We have built a single python script that does all the visualisation for you. It works with one call to the script: _*easy peasy!!*_

Unfortunately there are a few hiccups in getting the python installed, which we describe in the section <<Setting up Python>>.

This will be slightly different than instructions in that section, since the advice there is to run python scripts from *spyder*. In this instance, we will run from command line. 

Also, I am afraid there are some stupid things you need to do to get the tools working. If you are in MacOS or Linux, I hope things will work out of the box. On Windows, you need to do 2 things:

. Search for the file *gcs.csv*. Note the folder in which it is located. On my system it is in `C:\Miniconda2\Library\share\gdal`
. Go into the control panel, go to system, click on advanced system settings and in system variables enter a new variable: *GDAL_DATA*. For the value of this enter the directory of where the gdal data is. 

Okay, now open a new powershell window and navigate to the *LSDMappingTools* directory. From there, you can call the plotting function:
