=== Visualising the results of our m/n analyses

We have built a single python script that does all the visualisation for you. It works with one call to the script: _*easy peasy!!*_

Unfortunately there are a few hiccups in getting the python installed, which we describe in the section <<Setting up Python>>.

This will be slightly different than instructions in that section, since the advice there is to run python scripts from *spyder*. In this instance, we will run from command line.
