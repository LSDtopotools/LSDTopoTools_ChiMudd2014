=== Options you need for calculating the most likely concavity

For these analyses you will use our multi-purpose channel analysis package: the *chi mapping tool*. We will assume you have already compiled the tool and know how to direct it to your data using the _driver file_. If you don't know about those things you'll need to go back a few chapters in this documentation. 

The good news is that we have automated the computations with a single switch in the driver function. In the driver file, you just need the option `estimate_best_fit_movern: true`.
However, there are a few more options that are important in generating sensible output for the analysis

==== The two key options

.Main options for performing a concavity or _m/n_ analysis
|===
|Keyword
|Input type
|Default value
|Description


|estimate_best_fit_movern
|bool
|false
|You need to switch this to `true` to perform all the analysis for channel concavity or _m/n_. 

|collinearity_MLE_sigma
|float
|1000
|This is a scaling factor for our maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). In our paper we demonstrate how this is simply a constant that can be removed from MLE calculations, so supervifically its value doesn't matter. However, if this value is low, then the MLE values will be zero and you will not get reliable results. If you are getting estimates of _m/n_ that are very low, it might be because sigma is too low. If this is the case you should increase sigma until the best fit values of _m/n_ do not change. *In most cases you can use the default but if you have very large networks you may need to increase this parameter*.

threshold_contributing_pixels: 5000
minimum_basin_size_pixels: 100000
maximum_basin_size_pixels: 400000
test_drainage_boundaries: false
find_largest_complete_basins: false
find_complete_basins_in_window: true

|threshold_contributing_pixels
|int
|1000
|This is the minimum number of contributing pixels to form a channel. Lower values will result in denser channel networks. 

|minimum_basin_size_pixels
|int
|5000
|This is the minimum size of basin in terms of contributing pixels at the outlet. 

|maximum_basin_size_pixels
|int
|500000
|This is the maximum size of basin in terms of contributing pixels at the outlet. 

|find_complete_basins_in_window
|bool
|true
|*THIS MUST BE TRUE*. The default value is true so you don't actually need this in the parameter file, but we list it here because it is important to highlight. The program only takes basins that fall between the minimum and maximum basin size, it does not have nested basins, and, importantly, *it removes any basin that borders a no data pixel.* This ensures that you never analyse basins that are beheaded by the edge of the DEM, which would lead to erroneous chi values.

==== Other options: all have sensible defaults

There are a number of other options you can choose in the _m/n_ analysis but we have extensively tested the method on dozens of numerical and real test landscapes and the defaults work under most conditions. We encourage users to test the sensitivity of their results to these parameters, but for initial analyses you should not have to change any extra parameters.
