=== Options you need for calculating the most likely concavity

For these analyses you will use our multi-purpose channel analysis package: the *chi mapping tool*. We will assume you have already compiled the tool and know how to direct it to your data using the _driver file_. If you don't know about those things you'll need to go back a few chapters in this documentation. 

The good news is that we have automated the computations with a single switch in the driver function. In the driver file, you just need the option `estimate_best_fit_movern: true`.
However, there are a few more options that are important in generating sensible output for the analysis

==== Some key options

[cols="1,1,1,2", options="header"]
.Main options for performing a concavity or _m/n_ analysis
|===
|Keyword
|Input type
|Default value
|Description


|estimate_best_fit_movern
|bool
|false
|You need to switch this to `true` to perform all the analysis for channel concavity or _m/n_. 

|collinearity_MLE_sigma
|float
|1000
|This is a scaling factor for our maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). In our paper we demonstrate how this is simply a constant that can be removed from MLE calculations, so superficially its value doesn't matter. However, if this value is low, then the MLE values will be zero and you will not get reliable results. If you are getting estimates of _m/n_ that are very low, it might be because sigma is too low. If this is the case you should increase sigma until the best fit values of _m/n_ do not change. *In most cases you can use the default but if you have very large networks you may need to increase this parameter*.

|threshold_contributing_pixels
|int
|1000
|This is the minimum number of contributing pixels to form a channel. Lower values will result in denser channel networks. 

|minimum_basin_size_pixels
|int
|5000
|This is the minimum size of basin in terms of contributing pixels at the outlet. 

|maximum_basin_size_pixels
|int
|500000
|This is the maximum size of basin in terms of contributing pixels at the outlet.

==== Other options: all have sensible defaults

There are a number of other options you can choose in the _m/n_ analysis but we have extensively tested the method on dozens of numerical and real test landscapes and the defaults work under most conditions. We encourage users to test the sensitivity of their results to these parameters, but for initial analyses you should not have to change any extra parameters.

==== What the `estimate_best_fit_movern` routine does

If you set `estimate_best_fit_movern` you switch on all the routines for _m/n_ analysis, and plotting of the data. These switches are:

[source,paramfile]
----
# we need to make sure we select basins the correct way
find_complete_basins_in_window: true
print_basin_raster: true
write_hillshade: true
print_chi_data_maps: true

# run the chi methods of estimating best fit m/n
this_bool_map["calculate_MLE_collinearity: true
calculate_MLE_collinearity_with_points_MC: true
print_profiles_fxn_movern_csv: true
movern_residuals_test: true

# run the SA methods of estimating best fit m/n
print_slope_area_data: true
segment_slope_area_data: true
----

You can see what these do in the section: <<Parameter file options>>.
