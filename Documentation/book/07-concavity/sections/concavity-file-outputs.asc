=== Files output by the m/n analysis

The stem:[m/n] analysis will produce a number of new files in both raster and comma separated value formats. You can also tell the code to print csv files to geojson files if you want to directly load them into your favourite GIS. 

We expect most users will go straight to the figures generated by our python script, which should be publication quality. However, we list here the file outputs so you can inspect the data outputs ith which you can create your own plotting routines, if you so wish. We believe data should be transparent and reproducible, so all our python plots make figures from data that has been printed to file: you will always be able to see the data behind the figures. Please do not abuse our willingness to do this by taking our data and publishing horrible figures created in excel. 

==== Files created by the *chi mapping tool*

These files will be created by the *chi mapping tool* and will be located in the directory designated by the `read path` parameter in the parameter file.

|File type
|Description

|_AllBasinsInfo.csv
|csv
|A csv file that contains some information about the basins and their outlets. Used in our python plotting routines. 

|_chi_data_map
|csv
|This contains data for the channel pixels that is used to plot channels, such as location of the pixels (in lat-long WGS1984), elevation, flow distance, drainage area, and information about the basin and source key (the latter being a key to identify individual tributaries). Chi is also reported in this file, it is defaulted to _m/n_ = 0.5. To look at profiles with different _m/n_ values use `_movern`

|_movern
|csv
|This prints the chi-elevation profiles. The data includes locations f the channel points, and also chi coordinate for each point for every _m/n_ value analysed.

|File type
|Description

|_movernstats_XX_fullstats
|csv
|Contains the MLE and RMSE values for each tributary in each basin when compared to the trunk stream. Every _m/n_ value has its own file, so if _m/n_ = 0.1, the filename would be called `_movernstats_0.1_fullstats`.  

|_movernstats_basinstats
|csv
|This takes the total MLE for each basin, which is the product of the MLE values for each tributary in the basin, and reports these for each _m/n_ value investigated. Essentially collates MLE information from the `_movernstats_XX_fullstats` files.  

|_MCpoint_XX_pointsMC
|csv
|This reports on the results from the Monte-Carlo points approach. For each _m/n_ value, it samples points for `N` iterations (determined by the `MC_point_iterations` flag) and then calculates summary statistics for each basin. These include minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum MLE values. Each _m/n_ ratio gets its own file, so if _m/n_ = 1 the file is called `_MCpoint_0.1_pointsMC.csv`.

|_MCpoint_points_MC_basinstats
|csv
|This reports on the results from the Monte-Carlo points approach, compiling data from the `_MCpoint_XX_pointsMC.csv`. The file reports on each basin, with the first quartile, median and third quartile reported for every _m/n_ analysed. Note that now that I have gone through the trouble of writing this documentation it is unlikely these idiotic filenames will change. I take full responsiblity. Mi dispiache. SMM

|_movern_residuals_median
|csv
|This reports the median value of all the residuals of the full chi dataset between tributaries and the trunk stream. The idea here was that the best fit _m/n_ value might correspond to where residuals were evenly distributed above and below the main stem channel. After testing this, however, we found that this always overestimated _m/n_, so we do not include it in the summary plots. Retained here for completeness. The first and third quartile of residuals are also reported in their own files (`_movern_residuals_Q1` and `_movern_residuals_Q3`).

.Files associated with slope-area analysis

|File type
|Description

|_SAvertical
|csv
|This is the slope area data. Slope is calculated over a fixed vertical interval, where the area is calculated in the middle of this vertical interval. The interval is set by `SA_vertical_interval`. The vertical intervals do not cross tributary junctions so there should be no large jumps in drainage area within a verical interval.

|_SAbinned
|csv
|This is the slope area data averaged into log bins. Summary statistics are provided for each bin (see column headings). The width of the log bins is determined by `log_A_bin_width`.

|_SAsegmented
|csv
|This contains information about the segments in log S- log A space determined by the segmentation algorithm of http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/abstract[Mudd et al. 2014]. The minimum segment length is set by `slope_area_minimum_segment_length`. Regression statistics (slope, intercept, R^2^) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbin%E2%80%93Watson_statistic[Durbin-Watson] statistics are reported for each segment.
