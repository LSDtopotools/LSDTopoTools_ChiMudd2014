=== Files output by the m/n analysis

The stem:[m/n] analysis will produce a number of new files in both raster and comma seperated value formats. You can also tell the code to print csv files to geojson files if you want to directly load them into your favourite GIS. 

We expect most users will go straight to the figures generated by our python script, which should be publication quality. However, we list here the file outputs so you can inspect the data outputs ith which you can create your own plotting routines, if you so wish. We believe data should be transparent and reproducible, so all our python plots make figures from data that has been printed to file: you will always be able to see the data behind the figures. Please do not abuse our willingness to do this by taking our data an publishing horrible figures created in excel.

|estimate_best_fit_movern
|bool
|false
|You need to switch this to `true` to perform all the analysis for channel concavity or _m/n_. 

|collinearity_MLE_sigma
|float
|1000
|This is a scaling factor for our maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). In our paper we demonstrate how this is simply a constant that can be removed from MLE calculations, so supervifically its value doesn't matter. However, if this value is low, then the MLE values will be zero and you will not get reliable results. If you are getting estimates of _m/n_ that are very low, it might be because sigma is too low. If this is the case you should increase sigma until the best fit values of _m/n_ do not change.
