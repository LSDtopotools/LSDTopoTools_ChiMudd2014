=== Files output by the m/n analysis

The stem:[m/n] analysis will produce a number of new files in both raster and comma seperated value formats. You can also tell the code to print csv files to geojson files if you want to directly load them into your favourite GIS. 

We expect most users will go straight to the figures generated by our python script, which should be publication quality. However, we list here the file outputs so you can inspect the data outputs ith which you can create your own plotting routines, if you so wish. We believe data should be transparent and reproducible, so all our python plots make figures from data that has been printed to file: you will always be able to see the data behind the figures. Please do not abuse our willingness to do this by taking our data an publishing horrible figures created in excel.
