=== Running the m/n analysis

As with all of our tools, we suggest you keep your data and the source code seperate. We will assume the standard directory struture descrbed in the section: <<Installing the code and setting up directories>>.

We will assume your data is in the folder `/LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_chi_examples`, which you can clone from github. 

A very simple driver file is in the example folder, called `movern_Xian.driver`. This is the driver function:

[source,paramfile]
----
# Parameters for performing chi analysis
# Comments are preceeded by the hash symbol
# Documentation can be found here: 
# https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/

# These are parameters for the file i/o
# IMPORTANT: You MUST make the write directory: the code will not work if it doesn't exist. 
read path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_chi_examples
write path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_chi_examples
read fname: Xian
write fname: Xian_movern
channel heads fname: NULL

# Parameter for filling the DEM
min_slope_for_fill: 0.0001

# Parameters for selecting channels and basins
threshold_contributing_pixels: 5000
minimum_basin_size_pixels: 100000
maximum_basin_size_pixels: 400000
find_complete_basins_in_window: true

# Everything you need for an m over n analysis
estimate_best_fit_movern: true
----

. All you need to do is run ths file using the *chi_mapping_tool*. If you followed instructions for installing the software, this tool will be in the directory `/LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_`. Navigate to that folder:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTool_ChiMudd2014/driver_functions_MuddChi2014/
----
+
. Now run the correct driver file:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ./chi_mapping_tool.exe /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_chi_examples movern_Xian.driver
----
+
. Congratulations! You have set your first movern analysis running. It might take a little while to work its way though all the analyses so sit back, relax, and catch up on some http://www.bbc.co.uk/football/hibernianfc/[important news]. When it finishes you will be ready to visualise your data.
