=== All options used in the m/n analyses

This is a complete list of the options that are used in the stem:[m/n] analysis. Note that many other options are possible for printing, basin selection and output data formats. You will find all possible options in the section: <<Parameter file options>>.

|Description


|estimate_best_fit_movern
|bool
|false
|You need to switch this to `true` to perform all the analysis for channel concavity or _m/n_. 

|collinearity_MLE_sigma
|float
|1000
|This is a scaling factor for our maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). In our paper we demonstrate how this is simply a constant that can be removed from MLE calculations, so supervifically its value doesn't matter. However, if this value is low, then the MLE values will be zero and you will not get reliable results. If you are getting estimates of _m/n_ that are very low, it might be because sigma is too low. If this is the case you should increase sigma until the best fit values of _m/n_ do not change.
