=== Interpreting results from the _m/n_ analyses and pitfalls

We have tested these routines across a number of landscapes and hope that other workers will find them useful and enhance their own work. Here we explore a number of issues we have come across in interpreting results from these analyses. 

==== Uncertainty and confidence in the results

There are issues in both slope-area analysis and chi-based methods of estimating concavity (stem:[\theta]) and the _m/n_ ratio. S-A data is extremely noisy, whereas the chi method makes some assumptions about how channels erode. In real landscapes, there in no way to test if the extracted _m/n_ ratio is correct. 

We have attempted to understand how well these methods do using numerical models that force to opey the stream power law. This has the obvious drawback that we don't know if the stream power law is representative of channel erosion processes in any given landscape. But at a minimum we can force an _m/n_ ratio under idealised, simulated conditions and see how well the methods are able to reproduce the correct _m/n_ ratio. 

We have performed a number of simulations where uplift (and thus erosion) rates vary in time, where the _n_ exponent varies between model runs, and where both uplift and erodibility vary in space. The latter two violate assumption of the chi method but in real landscapes many of these assumptions will be violated and we wanted to know if one could still extract reasonable approximations of the _m/n_ ratio. 

What we found was that slope area analysis performs the worst when reconstructing _m/n_ values, whereas our monte carlo points method performs the best: even in highly perturbed landscapes the true _m/n_ ratio fell within the error bounds of the compute _m/n_ ratio. For full reporting of these results please see our upcoming ESURF paper (as of 14-September we are not finished but we hope to submit in October). 

*For slope-area analysis*, we tried to estimate uncertainty initially by getting the uncertainties on the regression coefficients of log S-log A data (we did this with bootstrapping and looking standard uncertainties of regression coefficients found in typical statistical packages). The problem with this is that there are very large numbers of data points and these uncertainty metrics are reduced (i.e. lower uncertanty) as more data is added. So the regression coefficents, according to these metrics, are very certain, but compared to model runs the coefficients are wrong! Our appraoch has been to estimate the _m/n_ ratio for all tributaries, and for segments of the channel network, as well as for all data and for the truck channel, and report all the values. These have very high ranges of values in most landscapes. Overall our reccomendation is that if slope area data agrees with chi-based metrics that one can have high confidence in the estimated _m/n_ values but otherwise slope area data should be treated with caution. 

*For chi-based analyses*, we tried several methods. Firstly, we compare the fit between all tributary data and the trunk channel. Since all data is used, there are no measures of uncertainty. This is quite unstatisfying so the second method we used was to randomly select a fixed number of points at fixed locations upstream of the tributary junction, calculate the likelyhood based on these points, and iterate using this method several hundred or even thousand times. This allows is to calculate a range of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for each _m/n_ ratio, and we then can calculate the uncertainty bands. We do this by using the minimum MLE value for the most likely _m/n_ and then seeing where this is equal to the maximum value of MLE for other _m/n_ ratios. 

==== Parameter values that appear to influence results

There are a few parameter values that can influence results. 

* Basin selection is quite important, especially for chi methods. Our chi methods compare the chi-elevation profiles of tributaries to the trunk channel. This means that if your basin has no or few tributaries you will not get particulary robust results. This is also the case if all of your tributaries are quite short. You can increase the number and lenght of tributaries by either increasing the basin size (so increasing `minimum_basin_size_pixels` and `minimum_basin_size_pixels`) or by reducing the threshold contributing area to initiate a channel (`threshold_contributing_pixels`).

* Avoiding fan surfaces or alluvial surfaces: Our tools are mainly designed for mountain landscapes. Alluvial fans and alluvial channel have different concavities than bedrock channels. In addiiton, these tend to be low relief surfaces so slope values are very sensitive to topographic errors. By turning `remove_seas: true` and setting the `minimum_elevation` to a value that is the approximate elevation of your mountain front.

* The `collinearity_MLE_sigma` should be increased if you are finding that most of your _m/n_ ratios are coming out as the same, very low value. Sometimes channels have low concavity! But sometimes the MLEs in a basin are all zero and in this case the code defaults to the lowest _m/n_ value given (`start_movern`). You can tell if channels are actually low concavity by looking at the chi plots.
