=== A: Getting your lithologic data ready

Lithologic datasets need to be formatted to be understable by LSDTopoTools. Basically, the analysis just need a raster with areas containing different values and a csv file containing the signification of the keys. The code will then format the raster with the right extent to `_LITHRAST.bil`. Your lithokey file needs to have a name finishing with `_lithokey.csv` and needs to have the following headers: `ID`, containing the data string, and `rocktype`, containing the corresponding value in the raster. 

Generating these files can be made manually or with any major GIS, but formatting errors can easily be made. We propose there a method to generate automatically all these file with the right format from a shapefile containing the geological information. You will need Python to use the generating script, you can refer to the <<Using Python>> section for instruction about installation.

The Python script that automate this process is present in the LSDMappingTools plotting library developped in parallel of LSDTopoTools. You can refer to the section <<Getting our plotting tools>> to download the needed repository. The script we are going to use is called `Rasterization.py` and can be executed without modifying the code, only using the command line.
