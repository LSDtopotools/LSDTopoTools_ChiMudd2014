= LSDTopoTools Chi Tools from Mudd et al 2014


IMPORTANT: If you are new to our software and want to get started with the minimum amount of bother, you should read our documentation on http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_installing_lsdtopotools_on_a_windows_machine_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant[setting up LSDTopoTools].
We also have videos to help you do so:

This folder contains source code for the Chi analysis tools described in http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/full[Mudd et al (2014), open access].
It also contains source code for mapping the chi coordinate and channel steepness for entire landscapes.

This code is part of the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools software package].

The versions here are updated on a semi regular basis. 

For instructions, go to the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/[LSDTopoTools documentation website].

Instructions specific to this package are in the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_chi_analysis[chapter on chi analysis]
If you want to map and entire landscape (either for chi or chi steepness) the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_chi_analysis_part_3_getting_chi_gradients_for_the_entire_landscape[instructions are here]. If you want to calculate the channel steepness index you can run this code and set the pass:[A_0] parameter to 1. 

== Quick Guide

If you are already familiar with this software, here as a quick reminder:

. Clone this repository (or, if you have already cloned it, `pull` any updates). 
Note that our http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_installing_lsdtopotools_on_a_windows_machine_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant[vagrantfiles automate this for you]. 
. Navigate into the *driver_functions_MuddChi2014* folder.
. Compile the code using `make`:
+
[source, console]
----
$ make -f chi_step1_write_junctions.make
$ make -f chi_step2_write_channel_file.make
$ make -f chi_get_profiles.make
$ make -f chi_m_over_n_analysis.make
----
+
. Put your data and the parameter file (see http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_steps_involved_to_perform_channel_analysis[the section on steps for chi analysis])
into an appropriate folder. 
. Use *./chi1_write_junctions.exe* to find the junctions and *./chi2_write_channel_file.exe*
. You can perform m/n analysis or just get chi profiles using the other programs.

== Visualising the data

The plotting scripts live in another repository: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDPlotting[get them here].
