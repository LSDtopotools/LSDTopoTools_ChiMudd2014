== LSDTopoTools Chi Tools

These are tools to perform integral analysis of channel profiles (often called "chi profiles") to understand the relative steepness of channels normalised by drainage area. This has a number of applications including looking for tectonic, climatic, and lithologic controls on river profiles. 

This folder contains source code for the Chi analysis tools described in http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/full[Mudd et al. (2014)].
It also contains source code for mapping the chi coordinate and channel steepness for entire landscapes.

It also contains algorithms for calculating the concavity index of a landscape described in [Mudd et al. (2018, ESURF)]. 

IMPORTANT: Unless you are trying to reproduce the analysis in http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/full[Mudd et al. (2014)], you should skip to the new *chi mapping tool*, which is newer, faster, more powerful, and has many more features. 

== The *chi mapping tool*

Documentation for the chi mapping tool can be found here: https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_chi_analysis.html


=== Quick guide

This assumes:

* You have a linux operating system. 
** If you do not have a linux system see our documentation on https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_installation.html[setting up LSDTopoTools]. With these documents you will be able to run these tools in any operating system.  
** Alternatively you can use either https://www.docker.com/docker-windows[docker for windows] or https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/[docker for MacOS]: see instructions here: https://hub.docker.com/r/afriel/lsdtopotools/ These tools only work on windows if you have Windows 10 enterprise. 

. You need a directory in your linux system called `LSDTopoTools`. 
. Into that directory downloar our script https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/blob/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py[LSDTopoToolsSetup.py]. You can download directly with:
+
[source,console]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py
----
+
. Run the setup tool
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTopoToolsSetup.py -id 1 -ChiM True
----
+
. This will download and compile the program in the directory `./Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/driver_functions_MuddChi2014/`. The program will be called `chi_mapping_tool.exe`. 
. For use, https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[read the documentation].

=== Plotting the data

See the documentation for both https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[the chi tools] and for https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_visualisation.html[generalised visualisation] to get started plotting the outputs from this software. 

Our plotting tools live in https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDMappingTools[the *LSDMappingTools* repository].

== The chi tools from Mudd et al 2014 (these are the old versions)

IMPORTANT: If you are new to our software and want to get started with the minimum amount of bother, you should read our documentation on https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_installation.html[setting up LSDTopoTools].

This code is part of the http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools software package].

The versions here are updated on a semi regular basis. 

For instructions, go to the https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/index.html[LSDTopoTools documentation website].

Instructions specific to this package are in the https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_chi_analysis.html[chapter on chi analysis]
If you want to map and entire landscape (either for chi or chi steepness) the https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_documentation/LSDTT_chi_analysis.html#_examples_of_chi_analysis[instructions are here]. If you want to calculate the channel steepness index you can run this code and set the pass:[A_0] parameter to 1. 

=== Quick Guide to old (2014) version (FOR LEGACY ONLY: DON'T USE THIS)

If you are already familiar with this software, here as a quick reminder:

. Clone this repository (or, if you have already cloned it, `pull` any updates). 
. Navigate into the *driver_functions_MuddChi2014* folder.
. Compile the code using `make`:
+
[source, console]
----
$ make -f chi_step1_write_junctions.make
$ make -f chi_step2_write_channel_file.make
$ make -f chi_get_profiles.make
$ make -f chi_m_over_n_analysis.make
----
+
. Put your data and the parameter file (see http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_steps_involved_to_perform_channel_analysis[the section on steps for chi analysis])
into an appropriate folder. 
. Use *./chi1_write_junctions.exe* to find the junctions and *./chi2_write_channel_file.exe*
. You can perform m/n analysis or just get chi profiles using the other programs.
